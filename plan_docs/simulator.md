# Brainstorm: Leveraging the prunt3d Simulator to Improve krusty-rs

This document outlines concrete ways to use the prunt3d simulator to accelerate development, testing, and quality of the `krusty-rs` 3D printer OS. All ideas are tailored to this repository’s async Rust architecture, modular design, and CI workflow.


## 1. Core Development & Testing
- **Safe, Rapid Iteration:** Use the simulator to test changes to core modules (`printer.rs`, `motion/`, `hardware/`, `gcode/`, `print_job.rs`) without risking real hardware. Enables fast prototyping and validation of new features (motion planning, error handling, async task orchestration).
- **Automated Regression Testing:** Integrate the simulator into CI to run `cargo test` and integration tests on every commit, using simulated hardware responses to catch bugs before they reach real printers.
- **Advanced Debugging:** Use the simulator to set breakpoints, inspect async state, and trace issues in motion control, G-code parsing, and hardware abstraction layers that are hard or dangerous to reproduce on real hardware (e.g., thermal runaway, stepper faults).


## 2. Print Quality & Motion Optimization
- **Parameter Tuning:** Simulate different print parameters (velocity, acceleration, input shaper settings) by running jobs through the `motion/` and `print_job.rs` modules, optimizing for quality and speed before deploying to real printers.
- **Failure Prediction:** Use simulation to identify and mitigate risks like layer shifts, missed steps, or support failures, reducing wasted time and material.
- **Thermal & Kinematic Analysis:** Model temperature and motion profiles to predict and prevent defects, especially for advanced materials or high-precision parts. Use the simulator to validate changes in `hardware/temperature.rs` and `motion/`.


## 3. User Experience, API, and Training
- **Virtual Printer Mode:** Use the simulator to provide a "virtual printer" for onboarding new users and developers, teaching them how to operate the OS and troubleshoot common issues in a risk-free environment.
- **G-code Preview & Validation:** Integrate the simulator with the web API (`web/`, `web/api.rs`) to allow users to preview prints, check for errors, and validate G-code before starting a real job.
- **Remote Support & Repro:** Enable support staff and contributors to reproduce and diagnose user issues using the simulator, improving response time and accuracy for bug reports and support tickets.


## 4. Diagnostics & Maintenance
- **Virtual Diagnostics:** Simulate hardware faults (sensor failures, stepper stalls, temperature excursions) to test and improve diagnostic routines and error recovery in `hardware/` and `printer.rs`.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Use simulation data to model wear and tear, helping to predict when maintenance is needed and reduce downtime. Feed simulated telemetry into future maintenance modules.


## 5. Advanced Features & Research
- **Algorithm Development:** Prototype and validate new motion planning, input shaping, or closed-loop control algorithms in `motion/` and `motion/planner/` using the simulator for safe, repeatable testing.
- **Integration & Stress Testing:** Simulate complex multi-printer or multi-material setups to test OS scalability and robustness, especially for async task orchestration and queue management.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Use the simulator to benchmark OS performance (motion queue, G-code throughput, web API latency) under various workloads and edge cases.


## 6. Community, CI, and Ecosystem
- **Open Innovation:** Allow contributors to test their code in the simulator, lowering the barrier to entry and increasing code quality. Encourage PRs to include simulator-based tests.
- **Plugin/Extension Sandbox:** Provide a safe environment for third-party plugin developers to test integrations with the OS, especially via the web API and G-code extensions.
- **Continuous Integration:** Use the simulator as a core part of the CI pipeline to ensure all new code is robust and hardware-safe before merging.

## Integration Plan: Connecting prunt3d Simulator to krusty-rs

This section outlines a concrete, step-by-step plan to integrate the prunt3d simulator with the krusty-rs async Rust codebase, enabling all the brainstormed use cases.

### 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- Refactor `hardware/` (and any direct hardware access in `printer.rs`, `motion/`, etc.) to use Rust traits for all hardware operations (motors, sensors, temperature, etc.).
- Implement both a `RealHardware` and a `SimulatedHardware` backend, both conforming to the same async trait interface (see [`embedded-hal-async`](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-async)).
- Use dependency injection (via generics or trait objects) to select the backend at runtime or in tests.

### 2. Simulator Backend Implementation
- Implement `SimulatedHardware` to communicate with the prunt3d simulator process (e.g., via TCP, Unix socket, or FFI), mimicking the real hardware protocol.
- Ensure all async operations (e.g., temperature reads, stepper moves) are faithfully simulated and can be controlled/deterministically seeded for tests.
- Add hooks for injecting faults, delays, or custom telemetry for advanced testing.

### 3. Test Harness and CI Integration
- Refactor integration and unit tests in `tests/` to use the simulator backend by default (using a cargo feature, environment variable, or test harness parameter).
- Use `tokio::time::pause` and deterministic RNG seeding to make tests reproducible and fast.
- Add property-based and stress tests that run only in the simulator (e.g., randomized G-code, hardware faults, async race conditions).
- Integrate simulator-based tests into the CI pipeline, ensuring all PRs are hardware-safe before merging.

### 4. Developer Workflow
- Document how to run krusty-rs in "simulator mode" for local development, debugging, and onboarding (e.g., `cargo test --features simulator`).
- Provide scripts or tools to launch the simulator and connect krusty-rs automatically.
- Encourage contributors to add simulator-based tests for new features and bugfixes.

### 5. Advanced Use Cases
- Add APIs or CLI tools to run parameter sweeps, failure injection, and performance benchmarks using the simulator.
- Expose simulator hooks in the web API for G-code preview, virtual printer mode, and remote support.

**Next Steps:**
1. Inventory all direct hardware access points in the codebase and refactor to use async traits.
2. Implement the `SimulatedHardware` backend and connect it to the prunt3d simulator.
3. Update tests and CI to use the simulator by default.
4. Document the workflow and add developer tooling.

## Notes & Improvement Ideas

### For prunt3d Simulator
- **Protocol Documentation:** Ensure the simulator’s hardware protocol is fully documented and versioned for robust integration.
- **Async/Deterministic Control:** Add support for deterministic simulation (controllable RNG, time, and event injection) to enable reproducible tests and CI runs.
- **Fault Injection API:** Expose APIs or CLI commands to inject hardware faults (e.g., sensor failures, stepper stalls, temperature excursions) on demand.
- **Telemetry Hooks:** Allow the simulator to stream detailed telemetry (e.g., stepper positions, temperature curves, event logs) for debugging and performance analysis.
- **Batch/Headless Mode:** Support running the simulator in a headless, batch mode for CI and automated testing.
- **Performance/Load Testing:** Add options to simulate multiple printers or high-throughput scenarios for stress testing the host OS.
- **Extensibility:** Make it easy to add new virtual hardware components or extend the protocol for future hardware features.

### For krusty-rs Host OS
- **Trait-based HAL:** Complete the migration to async trait-based hardware abstraction for all hardware-facing modules.
- **Simulator-First Testing:** Make simulator-based tests the default for CI and local development, with clear fallbacks to real hardware.
- **Test Utilities:** Provide utilities for writing property-based, randomized, and stress tests using the simulator backend.
- **Fault Handling:** Ensure all error handling and recovery logic is exercised in simulator-based tests (e.g., by scripting fault injection scenarios).
- **Developer Tooling:** Add scripts and docs for launching krusty-rs in simulator mode, including integration with the web API and G-code preview tools.
- **Observability:** Integrate logging, tracing, and metrics collection for both real and simulated hardware runs.
- **Plugin/Extension API:** Document and test the plugin/extension interface using the simulator, ensuring third-party code can be safely tested before deployment.
