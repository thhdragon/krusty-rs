// --- Heater/Thermistor Simulation Types ---
// Removed duplicate definitions of HeaterState, ThermistorState, ThermalEvent, and TemperatureController.

// REMOVED: impl HeaterState { ... }
// REMOVED: impl ThermistorState { ... }

// If any local methods or trait impls are needed for these types, implement them for the krusty_shared types here.

// Remove TemperatureStatus struct and use krusty_shared::ThermistorState or HeaterState as needed
