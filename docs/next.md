Here are suggestions for new homes for items that do not belong in host_os.rs, using your existing src folder structure:

---

### 4. Other Stubs (SerialProtocolStub, ClockSyncStub, EventBusStub)
- **Suggested home:** If these are only stubs, consider a new file: `src/stubs.rs`
  - Alternatively, place each in a dedicated file if they will grow in complexity (e.g., `src/serial_protocol.rs`, `src/clock_sync.rs`, `src/event_bus.rs`).

---

### 5. Public API Types (PrinterHostOS, etc.)
- **Suggested home:** lib.rs or mod.rs for re-exporting public API types.
  - Implementation details should remain in their respective files.

### Summary Table

| Item                   | Suggested Home                | Reason/Notes                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| SystemInfo             | config.rs / system_info.rs    | System metadata, config-related              |
| ModuleManagerStub      | module_manager.rs             | Dynamic module management                    |
| MultiMCUManagerStub    | multi_mcu_manager.rs          | Multi-MCU abstraction                        |
| Other stubs            | stubs.rs / dedicated files    | Centralize stub types                        |
| Public API types       | lib.rs / mod.rs               | For re-export, not implementation            |

If you want to keep all stub types together, create `src/stubs.rs`. Otherwise, split by responsibility for future maintainability.
