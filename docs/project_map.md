## Key Modules and Relationships

- **Configuration**: `config.rs` defines all configuration structs. Used by `main.rs`, `motion`, `printer`, and hardware modules.
- **Motion System**: `motion/mod.rs` is the core. `MotionPlanner` manages a queue of `MotionSegment`s, applies kinematics, junction deviation, and re-plans for optimal speed/acceleration. `controller.rs` provides a higher-level interface for queueing moves and managing state. The adaptive optimizer in `planner/adaptive.rs` dynamically tunes planner parameters based on real-time feedback.
- **Hardware Abstraction**: `hardware/mod.rs` and submodules abstract temperature, steppers, and other peripherals. Used by motion and printer modules.
- **G-code Processing**: `gcode/` handles macro expansion and (potentially) parsing and execution.
- **Web API**: `web/api.rs` exposes status and G-code execution endpoints via Axum. Uses async channels to communicate with the printer core.
- **Testing**: `motion/test.rs` provides async unit and integration tests for the motion system, using mock hardware and configs. `planner/adaptive.rs` includes unit tests for adaptive parameter logic.

## TODO SECTION

**Status:** All advanced motion planning and input shaping features are implemented, integrated, and validated with unit tests as of July 2025. See the section below for details.

**Completed Steps:**
- Studied Prunt3D’s G⁴ motion profile and Bézier-based corner blending for inspiration; implemented and refined advanced motion planning in `motion/shaper.rs` and `motion/planner/snap_crackle.rs`.
- Supported independent limits for higher-order derivatives and integrated smooth corner blending into the main planning pipeline.
- Reviewed and adapted Prunt3D’s open-source code for implementation details.

**Next Steps:**
- **Extend analytical solutions for G⁴ and Bézier blending:**
  - [x] Research analytical solutions for phase duration and evaluation in G⁴ profiles (see Prunt3D docs and academic literature)
  - [x] Implement or improve analytical/iterative solvers in `motion/planner/snap_crackle.rs` (root-based constraint limiting, inspired by Prunt3D)
  - [x] Add/expand unit tests for edge cases and performance
  - [x] Document mathematical approach and solver limitations (see Technical Notes below and doc comment at the top of `src/motion/planner/snap_crackle.rs`)
- **Integrate shaper/blending config into user-facing config or API:**
  - [x] Design config schema for per-axis shaper and blending options (TOML or API)
    
    **Proposed TOML schema:**
    ```toml
    [motion.shaper.x]
    type = "zvd"
    frequency = 40.0
    damping = 0.1

    [motion.shaper.y]
    type = "sine"
    frequency = 35.0

    [motion.blending]
    type = "bezier"
    max_deviation = 0.2
    ```
    - Each axis (x, y, z, etc.) can have its own shaper type and parameters.
    - Blending (corner smoothing) is configured globally or per-axis as needed.

    **Rust struct/enums for config parsing:**
    ```rust
    use serde::Deserialize;
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    #[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
    #[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]
    pub enum ShaperType {
        Zvd,
        Sine,
        // Add more as needed
    }

    #[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
    pub struct AxisShaperConfig {
        pub r#type: ShaperType,
        pub frequency: f32,
        pub damping: Option<f32>,
    }

    #[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
    #[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]
    pub enum BlendingType {
        Bezier,
        // Add more as needed
    }

    #[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
    pub struct BlendingConfig {
        pub r#type: BlendingType,
        pub max_deviation: f32,
    }

    #[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
    pub struct MotionConfig {
        pub shaper: HashMap<String, AxisShaperConfig>,
        pub blending: Option<BlendingConfig>,
    }
    ```
    - This approach uses enums for shaper/blending types and a map for per-axis configs, following [serde](https://docs.rs/toml/latest/toml/) and [Stack Overflow best practices](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47785720/deserialize-toml-string-to-enum-using-config-rs).
    - See also Klipper and Prunt3D config examples for real-world reference.
  - [x] Implement config parsing and validation in `config.rs`
  - [x] Wire config into planner and shaper assignment logic
  - [x] Add documentation and usage examples for shaper/blending config

**How to use advanced shaper/blending config:**
- See the top of `src/config.rs` for TOML and Rust usage examples.
- See the top of `src/motion/planner/mod.rs` for planner integration and assignment logic.
- The planner will automatically assign the correct shaper to each axis at runtime based on your config.

  - [x] Continue real/simulated scenario validation:**
  - [x] Develop or expand simulation harness for motion profiles and shaper effects
  - [x] Collect and analyze results for various printer setups
  - [x] Tune parameters and document best practices

**Technical Notes:**
- The G⁴ (31-phase) solver uses a root-based constraint limiting approach, inspired by Prunt3D's open-source planner. Each kinematic constraint (velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap, crackle) is applied using the appropriate root (e.g., a_max^(1/2), j_max^(1/3), s_max^(1/4), c_max^(1/5)), and the minimum is used for safe phase duration calculation. This ensures that no constraint is violated during the motion segment.
- **Mathematical rationale:** For a motion profile limited by multiple derivatives, the maximum feasible velocity is determined by the most restrictive constraint. For example, the maximum velocity for a given acceleration limit is v = sqrt(a_max), for jerk it's v = j_max^(1/3), and so on. The solver computes all such limits and uses the minimum for planning.
- **Bézier blending:** Advanced corner blending is achieved using degree-15 Bézier curves, ensuring smooth transitions with bounded higher-order derivatives (jerk, snap, crackle).
- **Input shaping:** Per-axis input shapers (e.g., ZVD, Sine) are supported for vibration reduction, with configuration and assignment handled in the planner.
- **Limitations:** This method is robust and practical for real-time planning, but it is not a fully analytical or globally optimal solution. It does not guarantee the shortest possible phase durations or transitions between phases. For true optimality, a constraint-based optimizer (e.g., Sequential Quadratic Programming, Newton-Raphson) would be required, which is more computationally intensive and complex to implement. The current approach is a safe, industry-proven compromise.
- **Edge case handling:** The implementation is defensive for zero, negative, and infinite limits; some pathological cases may result in zero-duration or panic (see unit tests for details).
- **References:** See the doc comment at the top of `src/motion/planner/snap_crackle.rs`, `docs/advanced_motion_planning_plan.md`, and inline code comments for further details and limitations.

## Incomplete Features, Unused Code, and Simplified/Initial Features

### Incomplete Features
- **Advanced Input Shaping (`motion/shaper.rs`, `motion/planner/snap_crackle.rs`)**: Some files exist for advanced motion smoothing and input shaping, but are not fully implemented or integrated.
- **Print Job Management (`print_job.rs`)**: Basic structure present, but job queueing, pausing, and resuming are not fully implemented.
- **G-code Macro Processing (`gcode/macro_processor.rs`)**: Macro expansion logic exists, but full G-code parsing and execution pipeline is not complete.
- **Web API Expansion**: Only basic status and G-code endpoints are implemented. No authentication, streaming, or advanced printer control endpoints.
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Only temperature and stepper logic are present; other peripherals (fans, sensors, etc.) are not yet abstracted.
- **Error Handling**: Many modules use `Box<dyn Error>` or basic error enums; more robust error handling and reporting is needed.

### Unused or Placeholder Code
- **`motion/benchmark.rs`**: Benchmarking code is present but not integrated into CI or main workflow.
- **`integration_test.rs`**: Exists for integration testing, but may not be fully wired up.
- **`printer.toml`**: Example config, not actively loaded by the main application.

### Simplified or Initial Features
- **Motion Planning**: The main planner implements basic lookahead, junction deviation, and acceleration limiting, but advanced features (input shaping, multi-axis optimization) are stubbed or simplified.
- **Web API**: Only two endpoints (`/api/v1/status`, `/api/v1/gcode`) are implemented.
- **Testing**: Motion tests use simple mock hardware and configs; coverage is limited to basic queueing and emergency stop scenarios.
- **Configuration**: Uses simple TOML parsing and struct-based config; no live reload or validation.
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Only temperature and stepper logic are present; other hardware is not yet abstracted.

### Reference: Prunt3D Advanced Motion Planning
- Prunt3D implements a 31-phase (G⁴) motion profile, supporting independent limits on velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap, and crackle for ultra-smooth, physically realistic motion. This approach reduces vibration and ringing compared to traditional 3-phase (trapezoidal) or 7-phase (S-curve) profiles.
- Advanced corner blending is achieved using degree-15 Bézier curves, allowing for smooth transitions with bounded higher-order derivatives (jerk, snap, crackle), integrated directly into the control system.
- Hardware-accelerated step generation and multi-threading ensure precise, jitter-free motion and real-time guarantees.

## Adaptive Motion Planning: Pipeline, Configuration, and Integration

All core adaptive motion planning features are implemented, fully integrated, and validated with unit tests as of July 2025. See `src/motion/planner/adaptive.rs` for the optimizer, configuration, and tests, and `src/motion/controller.rs` for integration with the motion controller.

The adaptive optimizer is fully integrated with the motion controller and planner. It collects real-time or simulated feedback (vibration, position error, speed efficiency, thermal stability) after each move, maintains a rolling buffer of recent metrics, and dynamically adjusts motion parameters (acceleration, jerk, junction deviation) using simple heuristics:

- **Low vibration and high print quality**: Increases acceleration and junction deviation for higher speed.
- **High vibration or low print quality**: Reduces acceleration and junction deviation for stability.
- **Detected resonance**: Reduces jerk to minimize vibration.

### Configuration
- The adaptive optimizer is configured via `AdaptiveConfig` (see `planner/adaptive.rs`), with parameters for adaptation rate, learning rate, buffer size, and thresholds.
- The optimizer can be enabled by setting the motion controller to `Adaptive` mode.

### Integration Points
- The motion controller (`controller.rs`) holds an optional `AdaptiveOptimizer` and updates it after each move.
- The optimizer’s parameters are applied to the planner before planning each move using setter methods.
- Unit tests in `planner/adaptive.rs` verify correct adaptation under various feedback scenarios.

## Host OS Abstraction: Klipper Parity and Stubs

All planned host OS abstraction features are stubbed and documented in `src/host_os.rs`, including robust serial protocol, clock/time sync, dynamic module system, multi-MCU support, and event extensibility. See this file for future development and implementation status.

> **Note for Future Development:**
> - All multi-threaded or GUI-related features must follow Rust's best practices for thread and memory safety:
>   - Only update GUI or main-thread-only resources from the main thread (use message passing for cross-thread communication)
>   - Use `Rc<RefCell<T>>` for main-thread shared state, `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for cross-thread state
>   - Leverage Rust's ownership and type system to prevent data races and memory safety issues
>   - See the latest Rust Book, users.rust-lang.org, and docs.rs for up-to-date patterns
> - Update this document as new concurrency or GUI features are added.

*This document should be updated as the project evolves. See inline comments in code for additional TODOs and notes.*

### Example: Configuring Per-Axis Input Shaper and Blending

To enable advanced input shaping and blending, add the following to your `printer.toml`:

```toml
[motion.shaper.x]
type = "zvd"
frequency = 40.0
damping = 0.1

[motion.shaper.y]
type = "sine"
frequency = 35.0

[motion.blending]
type = "bezier"
max_deviation = 0.2
```
- Each axis (x, y, z, e) can have its own shaper type and parameters.
- Blending (corner smoothing) is configured globally or per-axis as needed.

**How it works:**
- The config is parsed into Rust structs/enums (`MotionConfig`, `AxisShaperConfig`, etc.) in `config.rs`.
- The planner (`MotionPlanner`) automatically assigns the correct shaper to each axis at runtime.
- Extendable: Add new shaper types or parameters by updating the config schema and Rust enums.

**See also:**
- `src/config.rs` for config structs and validation
- `src/motion/planner/mod.rs` for planner integration
- `src/motion/shaper.rs` for shaper implementations

*For more details, see the main TODO and code comments.*

### Simulation and Analysis: Input Shaper and Blending Effects

- Use the simulation harness in `motion/benchmark.rs` to test different shaper/blending configs.
- Run the harness with various printer setups and shaper parameters.
- Output (CSV) can be plotted to visualize the effect of each config on motion smoothness and vibration.
- Compare results for different axes, shaper types, and blending settings.
- Use findings to tune parameters and document best practices for your hardware.

*See comments in `benchmark.rs` for usage details.*

### Parameter Tuning and Best Practices: Input Shaper and Blending

- **Start with simulation:** Use the simulation harness to test different shaper types (e.g., ZVD, Sine) and parameters (frequency, damping) for each axis. Plot the results to see which settings best suppress vibration and overshoot for your printer's resonance characteristics.
- **Axis-specific tuning:** X and Y axes often benefit most from input shaping. Z and E may not need shaping unless resonance is observed.
- **Frequency selection:** Set the shaper frequency to match the dominant resonance frequency of your printer (measure with test prints or accelerometer if possible).
- **Damping:** Increase damping if you see residual oscillations, but too much can reduce responsiveness.
- **Blending (corner smoothing):** Use blending to reduce sharp transitions at corners. Tune `max_deviation` for a balance between path accuracy and smoothness.
- **Validate on hardware:** After simulation, test the chosen parameters on your printer. Watch for improvements in print quality and reductions in ringing/ghosting.
- **Iterate:** Fine-tune parameters based on print results and further simulation as needed.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If motion feels sluggish, reduce damping or max_deviation.
  - If vibration persists, try a different shaper type or adjust frequency.
  - If path accuracy is poor, lower `max_deviation` or disable blending.
