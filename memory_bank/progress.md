# Progress


## What Works
- Motion queueing and execution (TASK001) fully implemented, tested, and documented
- G-code macro/streaming parsing and macro expansion (TASK003) fully implemented, async/streaming, recursive, and robust; all tests pass
- Advanced motion planning (G⁴, Bézier blending, input shaping, adaptive optimizer) implemented and validated with unit tests
- Modular architecture for configuration, motion, hardware, G-code, and web API
- Dedicated test structure for all major subsystems


## What's Left to Build
- Print job management: job queueing, pausing, resuming, cancellation (TASK002)
- Web API: endpoints for pause, resume, cancel, status, authentication (TASK004)
- Hardware abstraction: modular interfaces, integration with main workflow (TASK005)
- Host OS abstraction: serial protocol, time sync, event system (TASK006)
- Error handling: robust enums, context, diagnostics (TASK007)
- Testing: increase coverage, automate result collection/reporting (TASK008)

## Current Status
Motion queueing and execution (TASK001) is complete and stable. Base system is under active development. Advanced motion planning and simulation are implemented and tested. Print job management, G-code streaming, web API, hardware/host OS abstraction, and robust error handling are in progress. Advanced features are deferred to `future_map.md`.



## Progress Log

### 2025-07-24
- Completed async/streaming G-code parser and macro expansion refactor (TASK003):
  - Refactored parser to use async-stream for idiomatic async streaming and macro expansion
  - Implemented recursive macro expansion in async context
  - Updated all affected tests; all tests now pass
  - Enabled RUST_BACKTRACE=1 for improved debugging

### 2025-07-24 (Memory Bank Review)
- Reviewed all memory bank files and task files for completeness and consistency.
- Confirmed that `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and all task files accurately reflect the current project state.
- No discrepancies or missing updates found; all documentation is current as of this date.

## Known Issues
- Print job management and G-code streaming are incomplete
- Web API is minimal; advanced endpoints and authentication missing
- Hardware abstraction is limited; host OS abstraction stubbed
- Error handling is basic in some modules
- No known issues with motion queueing and execution (TASK001)
