# Progress

## What Works
- Motion queueing and execution (TASK001) fully implemented, tested, and documented
- Advanced motion planning (G⁴, Bézier blending, input shaping, adaptive optimizer) implemented and validated with unit tests
- Modular architecture for configuration, motion, hardware, G-code, and web API
- Dedicated test structure for all major subsystems

## What's Left to Build
- Print job management: job queueing, pausing, resuming, cancellation (TASK002)
- G-code macro/streaming parsing: async/streaming, macro expansion, robust error recovery, integration with print job and motion system (TASK003)
- Web API: endpoints for pause, resume, cancel, status, authentication (TASK004)
- Hardware abstraction: modular interfaces, integration with main workflow (TASK005)
- Host OS abstraction: serial protocol, time sync, event system (TASK006)
- Error handling: robust enums, context, diagnostics (TASK007)
- Testing: increase coverage, automate result collection/reporting (TASK008)

## Current Status
Motion queueing and execution (TASK001) is complete and stable. Base system is under active development. Advanced motion planning and simulation are implemented and tested. Print job management, G-code streaming, web API, hardware/host OS abstraction, and robust error handling are in progress. Advanced features are deferred to `future_map.md`.


## Progress Log
### 2025-07-24
- Removed duplicate TASK011 entry from tasks/_index.md.
- Verified that all task statuses in _index.md match the individual task files (TASK001, TASK002).
- Memory bank is fully up to date and consistent with current project state.

## Known Issues
- Print job management and G-code streaming are incomplete
- Web API is minimal; advanced endpoints and authentication missing
- Hardware abstraction is limited; host OS abstraction stubbed
- Error handling is basic in some modules
- No known issues with motion queueing and execution (TASK001)
