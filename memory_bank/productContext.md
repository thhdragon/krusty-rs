# Product Context

## Purpose
Krusty-rs exists to provide a modern, modular, and extensible 3D printer host and motion control system, leveraging Rustâ€™s safety and async capabilities. It aims to enable advanced motion planning, robust hardware abstraction, and seamless integration with web APIs for next-generation 3D printing workflows.

## Problems Solved
- Lack of modern, extensible, and safe 3D printer hosts in Rust
- Difficulty integrating advanced motion planning and input shaping in existing hosts
- Limited support for real-time diagnostics, error handling, and simulation in legacy systems
- Fragmented hardware abstraction and poor testability in traditional firmware/host stacks

## User Experience Goals
- Reliable, high-performance printing with advanced motion quality
- Easy configuration, extensibility, and integration with other tools
- Modern web API for control, monitoring, and automation
- Clear diagnostics, error reporting, and simulation support for tuning and validation

## How It Should Work
Users configure their printer and motion system via TOML/JSON files, interact with the printer through a secure web API, and benefit from advanced motion planning and diagnostics. The system supports simulation and real hardware, with robust error handling and clear feedback throughout the workflow.
