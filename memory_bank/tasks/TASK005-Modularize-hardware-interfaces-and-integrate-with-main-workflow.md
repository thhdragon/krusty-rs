# TASK005 - Modularize hardware interfaces and integrate with main workflow

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-07-25  
**Updated:** 2025-07-25

## Original Request
Modularize hardware interfaces (temperature, steppers, peripherals) and integrate them with the main workflow. Ensure extensibility, async safety, and robust error handling. Refactor code to support easy addition of new hardware modules and seamless integration with motion and printer subsystems.

## Thought Process
- The current hardware abstraction is limited and not fully modular.
- Motion queueing and execution are stable and complete, so hardware integration should not break existing functionality.
- The system uses trait-based extensibility and async coordination via channels.
- Hardware modules must be real-time safe, async, and support robust error handling.
- Integration points include the motion subsystem, printer state, and web API.
- The refactor should enable easy addition of new hardware modules (e.g., sensors, actuators).
- All changes must be covered by unit and integration tests.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Review current hardware abstraction code in `src/hardware/` and integration points in `main.rs`, `motion/`, and `printer.rs`
- [ ] Design trait-based interfaces for hardware modules (temperature, steppers, peripherals)
- [ ] Refactor hardware modules to implement new traits and async interfaces
- [ ] Integrate hardware modules with motion and printer subsystems using async channels/message passing
- [ ] Ensure error handling uses robust enums and context (thiserror/anyhow)
- [ ] Update configuration to support modular hardware setup (TOML/JSON)
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for hardware modules and integration points
- [ ] Document new architecture and update Memory Bank as needed

## Progress Log
### 2025-07-25
- Documented new modular hardware architecture and updated Memory Bank:
    - Architecture, trait-based interfaces, async integration, and configuration format are documented.
    - All changes reflected in Memory Bank files for future reference.
    - Task marked as complete.
### 2025-07-25
- Added unit and integration tests for hardware modules and integration points:
    - Tests cover trait implementations for temperature, fan, and sensor modules.
    - Integration tests verify async channel communication and subsystem integration.
    - Error handling and edge cases are tested.
- Next: Document new architecture and update Memory Bank.
### 2025-07-25
- Updated configuration for modular hardware setup:
    - Added TOML/JSON sections for each hardware module (temperature, steppers, fans, peripherals).
    - Code parses these sections and instantiates hardware modules accordingly.
    - Configuration format documented for extensibility.
- Next: Add unit/integration tests for hardware modules and integration points.
### 2025-07-25
- Ensured robust error handling in hardware modules:
    - All trait implementations and hardware structs use custom error enums (`thiserror`).
    - Error context is propagated with `anyhow` where needed.
    - Trait signatures and implementations updated for contextual error types.
- Next: Update configuration for modular hardware setup (TOML/JSON).
### 2025-07-25
- Integrated hardware modules with motion and printer subsystems:
    - Refactored subsystems to use trait objects for hardware modules (temperature, stepper, peripherals).
    - Established async channels for communication between subsystems and hardware modules.
    - Updated constructors and methods to accept trait objects and channel senders/receivers.
- Next: Ensure robust error handling in hardware modules.
### 2025-07-25
- Refactored hardware modules to implement trait-based interfaces:
    - `TemperatureController` implements `TemperatureControllerTrait`.
    - `StepGenerator` implements `StepperControllerTrait`.
    - `FanController` and `GenericSensor` implement `PeripheralTrait`.
    - Error handling is robust and uses boxed errors for trait compatibility.
- Next: Integrate hardware modules with motion and printer subsystems using async channels/message passing.
### 2025-07-25
- Designed trait-based interfaces for hardware modules:
    - `TemperatureControllerTrait`, `StepperControllerTrait`, and `PeripheralTrait` defined in `hardware_traits.rs`.
    - Traits use `Result` for robust error handling and are `Send` for async safety.
    - These traits will be implemented by hardware modules to enable modularity and extensibility.
- Next: Refactor hardware modules to implement new traits and async interfaces.
### 2025-07-25

### 2025-07-25
- Completed review of hardware abstraction and integration points:
    - Hardware modules (temperature, steppers) are implemented as concrete structs, not traits.
    - Error handling uses thiserror and custom enums, but could be more contextual.
    - Async coordination via mpsc channels is established between web API and printer logic.
    - Integration points exist in main.rs and printer.rs, but hardware modules are not fully extensible or modular.
- Next: Design trait-based interfaces for hardware modules (temperature, steppers, peripherals).
