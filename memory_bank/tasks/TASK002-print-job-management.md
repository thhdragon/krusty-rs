# TASK002 - Print Job Management (queue, pause, resume, cancel)

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-07-24  
**Updated:** 2025-07-24

## Original Request
Implement print job management, including job queueing, pausing, resuming, and cancellation. Work is focused in `print_job.rs`.

## Thought Process
- Print job management is essential for robust, user-friendly 3D printing workflows.
- The system must support multiple queued jobs, allow pausing/resuming/cancelling jobs, and handle error recovery.
- Integration with G-code streaming, motion queue, and error handling is required.
- The design should be modular, testable, and extensible for future features (e.g., job prioritization, scheduling).
- Thread safety and async coordination are important for real-time and web API integration.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Review current state of `print_job.rs` and related modules
- [ ] Design a print job queue structure (FIFO, async/thread-safe if needed)
- [ ] Implement job enqueue, dequeue, pause, resume, and cancel operations
- [ ] Integrate with G-code streaming and motion queue
- [ ] Add error handling and state transitions
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for job management
- [ ] Document the API and usage patterns

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log
## API Documentation & Usage

See [`docs/print_job_manager.md`](../../docs/print_job_manager.md) for full API documentation, usage examples, and extensibility notes for the print job management module.

### 2025-07-24
- Comprehensive tests written for all state transitions and error cases in `print_job.rs`.
- Tests verify valid and invalid transitions, command streaming, and error handling.
- Subtask 2.6 marked as complete. Next: document API and usage patterns.
### 2025-07-24
- API and usage documentation added for `PrintJobManager` and related types.
- Usage examples provided for all major operations.
- Subtask 2.7 marked as complete. Task is now fully implemented and documented.
**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
### 2025-07-24
- Error handling and state validation implemented in `print_job.rs`:
  - All job-level operations now return `Result` types.
  - Invalid state transitions (e.g., pausing a completed job) return descriptive errors.
  - State machine is explicit and robust; all transitions are validated.
  - Subtask 2.5 marked as complete. Next: write tests for all state transitions and error cases.
### 2025-07-24
- Error handling and state validation plan:
  - All job-level operations in `PrintJobManager` will return `Result` types.
  - Invalid state transitions (e.g., pausing a completed job, resuming a cancelled job) will return errors with descriptive messages.
  - The state machine will be explicit, and all transitions will be validated before mutating state.
  - Errors will be logged or propagated to the caller for robust diagnostics.
  - Subtask 2.5 marked as In Progress. Next: implement error handling and state validation in code.
### 2025-07-24
- Channel-based integration implemented in `print_job.rs`:
  - `PrintJobManager` now takes a `tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender` for sending G-code commands to the motion queue or streaming subsystem.
  - Added an async method to process the current job and send commands through the channel.
  - This decouples job management from execution and enables robust async coordination.
  - Subtask 2.4 marked as complete. Next: add error handling and validate state transitions.
### 2025-07-24
- Integration plan for G-code streaming and motion queue:
  - Use `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels to send commands from `PrintJobManager` to the G-code streaming subsystem and motion queue.
  - The job manager will act as a producer, sending commands as jobs are processed.
  - The motion queue will act as a consumer, executing commands and reporting status back (optionally via another channel).
  - This decouples job management from execution and allows for robust async coordination.
- Marked subtask 2.4 as In Progress. Next: implement channel-based integration in code.
### 2025-07-24
- Refactored `print_job.rs`:
  - Added `JobState` enum and `PrintJob` struct (with state, commands, progress).
  - `PrintJobManager` now manages a queue of jobs using `tokio::sync::Mutex<VecDeque<PrintJob>>`.
  - Implemented async methods for enqueue, dequeue, pause, resume, and cancel at the job level, with explicit state transitions.
  - All job-level operations are async and stateful.
  - Minor lint warning remains for an unused variable in checksum conversion (does not affect functionality).
  - Subtask 2.3 marked as complete. Next: integration with G-code streaming and motion queue.
### 2025-07-24
- Reviewed `print_job.rs` code:
  - Stubs exist for `PrintJobManager` and `PrintJobState`.
  - Command queue is implemented, but job-level queueing and state transitions are not.
- Implementation plan for job queue operations:
  - Define a `PrintJob` struct with its own state (`JobState` enum).
  - Refactor `PrintJobManager` to manage a queue of `PrintJob` objects (using `Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<PrintJob>>>`).
  - Implement async enqueue, dequeue, pause, resume, and cancel operations at the job level.
  - Ensure state transitions are explicit and validated.
  - Integrate with command queueing and async methods as needed.
- Marked subtask 2.3 as In Progress. Next: implement/refactor code in `print_job.rs`.
### 2025-07-24
- Task file created and initialized with plan and subtasks.
- Reviewed `print_job.rs`:
  - `PrintJobManager` and `PrintJobState` exist as stubs.
  - Command queue uses `Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<Result<GCodeCommand, GCodeError>>>>` for async/thread-safe FIFO queueing.
  - Methods for queueing jobs, pausing, resuming, cancelling, and async command streaming are stubbed but not fully implemented.
  - Integration with motion and web API is not yet present (noted as TODO).
  - State tracking fields (`queued`, `running`, `paused`, `completed`, `progress`) are present in `PrintJobState`.
  - Async queueing from both Vec and Stream is supported, but only sets `queued` state.
- Documented print job queue and state machine design:
  - Use `Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<PrintJob>>>` or `tokio::sync::Mutex` for async/thread-safe FIFO queue.
  - Each `PrintJob` has a `JobState` enum: `Queued`, `Running`, `Paused`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`, `Error`.
  - `PrintJobManager` runs an async loop, processing jobs in FIFO order, with explicit state transitions.
  - Integration with G-code streaming and motion queue via async channels/events.
  - All public methods are async and return `Result`.
  - State transitions and error handling are documented and validated.
- Marked subtask 2.2 as complete. Next: implement job queue operations and state transitions in `print_job.rs`.
